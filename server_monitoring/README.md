# 🐕‍🦺 Server Monitoring

Create a Bash script that automates the process of monitoring a Linux server's resource usage:
- CPU
- Memory
- Disk space

# The script objectives:
- [x] Periodically collect server resource metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and disk space usage.
- [ ] Compare these metrics to predefined thresholds.
- [ ] If any metric exceeds its threshold, send an email notification with details about the high resource usage.
- [ ] Log the monitoring activity to a log file for future reference.
