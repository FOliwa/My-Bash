# 🚙 My-Bash

This is my bash playground created for learning purposes. As on a daily basis, I have to work from time to time with BASH, I decided to train a bit in BASH scripting. This repo is totally for fun and learning purposes - in this order.

## 🪛 Scripts

This repo contains scripts and related test data. The scripts were created for educational and entertainment purposes.

- 🦺 Easy Backup<br>
  Simple backup script for important files.

- 🗃️ File Organizer<br>
  This Bash script focuses on managing and organizing files in a provided directory by grouping them into subdirectories based on their file extensions.

- 🐕‍🦺 Server Monitoring<br>
  A Bash script that automates the process of monitoring a Linux server's resource usage.

- 🪨 System Hardener<br>
  A Bash script that automates common Linux system hardening tasks to enhance the security of a Linux server or system.

# 🍒 Disclaimer

All scripts were done to practice bash - as writing bash is enjoyable and better than watching 📺Netflix📺.
